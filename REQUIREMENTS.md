## Takeaway
To obtain the candidate and validated patches generated by KNOD (referring to the result of RQ1 in the paper), simply downloading the artifact is enough.

## Running or training KNOD
To train KNOD models and use KNOD models to generate patches, the Ubuntu system is recommended. Developers also need to have Docker installed in order to run the code in our docker image.
